    "1. Data Structure and Features:\n",
    "You have two types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical Stock Data: This includes features like open/close/high/low prices, volume, and volatility over the past few days.\n",
    "News Sentiment Data: This includes sentiment scores and information like positive/negative labels for news sentiment, plus historical news data for the past 5 days.\n",
    "2. Model Architecture:\n",
    "The best approach would involve two separate networks that are then merged at a later stage. One network will process the stock price data and the other will process the sentiment data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some model options:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model A: LSTM + Dense Neural Network (DNN) + Attention Layer\n",
    "Step 1: Process Historical Stock Data (LSTM):\n",
    "Since the stock data is sequential (time series), use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to capture temporal dependencies.\n",
    "LSTMs are great for predicting stock prices based on the past price patterns and trends.\n",
    "Input: Time series data (open, close, volume, volatility, etc.) Output: Processed feature representation of stock price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Process News Sentiment Data (DNN):\n",
    "Use a Dense Neural Network (DNN) to process the news sentiment data. The sentiment score and label can be fed directly into this network.\n",
    "You can concatenate the sentiment score (finbert_analysis) with other metadata like average price, volatility, and volume over the past 5 days for the stock.\n",
    "Input: Sentiment scores (positive/negative), and aggregated features from news (avg_price_5d, avg_volume_5d, volatility_5d). Output: Sentiment feature representation that reflects the impact of recent news.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Combine Both Networks:\n",
    "Merge the LSTM output (stock data) and the DNN output (sentiment data) into a single feature vector. This can be done using concatenation or element-wise addition.\n",
    "The combined features are then passed to one or more Dense layers to make the final prediction for stock price.\n",
    "Step 4: Final Prediction (Dense Layer):\n",
    "Use one or more dense layers to predict the stock price based on the combined representation from both networks. The final output would be the predicted stock price for the next day (or the target time period)."

    "Model B: Transformer-Based Architecture (For News + Stock Data)\n",
    "An alternative approach is to leverage Transformers, which can model sequential data (like stock price history) and learn the attention across different parts of the input (e.g., different days in the stock history, and different news articles).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Process Historical Stock Data (Transformer Encoder):\n",
    "Similar to the LSTM-based approach, you can use a Transformer Encoder for processing the time series of stock data. The self-attention mechanism in Transformers helps the model understand long-range dependencies in the price movements.\n",
    "Input: Time series data of stock prices. Output: Encoded feature representation for stock data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Process News Sentiment Data (Transformer Decoder):\n",
    "Feed the sentiment data and related features (news sentiment, avg_price_5d, avg_volume_5d) into another Transformer Decoder. The decoder can focus on learning which parts of the news impact the stock price more significantly.\n",
    "Input: Sentiment data and features (news sentiment scores, historical 5-day price features). Output: Encoded representation for sentiment data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Combine Stock Data and Sentiment Data:\n",
    "Merge the outputs of the transformer encoder (stock data) and transformer decoder (sentiment data) in a similar fashion to the LSTM-based model.\n",
    "Input: Combined representation of both stock data and sentiment data. Output: Final prediction of the stock price.\n",
