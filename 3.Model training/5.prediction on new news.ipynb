Although the reported growth exceeded our estimates, there was a meaningful pass-through component built into the revenue in 3Q that is unsustainable in 4Q. Additionally, the company anticipates mild furloughs in 4Q that will lead to weaker topline performance, despite the revision in revenue guidance. Barring the anticipated quarterly volatility, the underlying demand is picking up pace. The BFS spending which until now was restricted to the US region, has extrapolated to Europe that is evident through sustainable growth in BFS and improving deal pipeline. Even Retail/CPG vertical is shaping up well with improved consumer sentiment in the US regions. The small size deals (< $50m) reported another quarter of double-digit growth, while the large deal funnel is showing strength. Although the NN component within the deal TCV has improved materially to ~60%, the cost optimization theme is still being prioritized over transformation initiatives. We believe the improved demand scenario beyond BFS and elevated deal TCV with higher NN component would help drive growth in FY26/FY27. Considering the meaningful pass-through component and extended furloughs, we are expecting a revenue de-growth in 4Q, which will translate to FY25 growth of 4.8% YoY CC. We are baking in revenue growth of 7.7%/11.8% YoY CC in FY26E/FY27E. EBIT Margins in 3Q was fairly in line with our estimates. Weak anticipated topline growth along with partial wage revision (for junior) scheduled in Q4, will have an incremental impact on margins. Having said that, the comprehensive margin expansion program (Project Maximus), pyramid rationalization, offshoring and automation would negate some of the margin impact. Hence, we are keeping our margin estimates broadly unchanged at 21.0%/21.6%/22.2% in FY25E/FY26E/FY27E. INFY has a robust play on the front-end offering and execute on the large-size transformation deals. With improving discretionary spends, we expect the global enterprises to resume their long-deferred discretionary programs, where INFY would be wining disproportionately among its peers on quality execution and full-stake offerings. We estimate USD revenues/earnings CAGR of 7.5%/12% over FY24-FY27E. The stock is currently trading at 23x FY27E, we are assigning P/E of 27x to FY27E with a target price of INR 2,250.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank AXSB saw a weak quarter as loan growth, fees and asset quality were a miss. However, core PPoP beat PLe by 2.2% as opex was 7.5% lower to PLe following softer balance sheet accretion. Slippages/provisions remained elevated due to continued unsecured stress and seasonality in agri. Loan growth was weaker at 8.8% YoY led by slowdown in retail. Bank commentary suggests that loan offtake would remain challenged due to constrained deposit addition. We trim loan/deposit growth for FY25/26/27E by avg. 2.6%/3.4% which would be partly offset by cut in opex by avg. 5.6%. Hence our core PAT for FY26/27E is lower by 3.2%/6.3%. While target multiples could be lowered across the banking sector due to a tough macro environment, quantum cut would be higher for AXSB due to weaker loan growth/asset quality.

Shoppers Stop (SHOP) reported in-line results, with a slight pick-up in revenue growth (+9% YoY) on 4% LFL growth (-4% YoY in 2Q). EBITDA rose 11% YoY, driven by higher gross margins on lower write-offs and improved intake margins in private brands.

Geojit Financial Services\\'s report on Daily Agri Picks Though the El Nino–Southern Oscillation is currently in the \\'La Nina Watch\\' range, the possibility of La Nina emerging between February and July is unlikely, the APEC Climate Center said in a report Wednesday. El Nino–Southern Oscillation \\'neutral\\' conditions are the most probable during the forecast period, with the chances increasing to 72.5% from 53.6%, according to the report. In the 2024-25 (Oct-Sept) season, mills in India have produced 13.1 million tonnes of sugar as of Wednesday, down 13.7% from 15.1 million tonnes produced in the same period a year ago, according to data from the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories. Rabi sowing across the country as of Friday was 63.2 million hectares, up just 0.1% from last year, according to data from the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The area sown under wheat, the main rabi crop, was up 1.4% on year at 32.0 million hectares, the data showed. The area under rabi paddy was up 2.6% on year at 2.21 million hectares. The acreage under maize rose nearly 10% on year to 2.24 million hectares. Above-normal rainfall during the southwest monsoon led to higher moisture content in the soil, which aided the sowing of rabi crops. The country received 8% above normal rainfall at 934.8 mm in the southwest monsoon, according to the India Meteorological Department. In the northeast monsoon, in the Oct. 1 to Dec. 31 period, India received 117.4 mm rainfall, 3% below the normal of 121.0 mm, according to the IMD. Since Jan. 1, the country has received 1.4 mm rainfall, 64% below the normal of 3.8 mm for the period. The area under pulses was 13.98 million hectares, up 0.5% from 13.91 million hectares a year ago, the data showed. Under pulses, the acreage of chana was 9.67 million hectares, up 0.8% from the area sown in the previous year. Chana is the main legume grown during the rabi season. Masur acreage was down nearly 2% at 1.74 million hectares. Chana acreage is likely to rebound to its normal of 10 million hectares from the fall seen last year, though the yield will depend on the weather in January and February, G. Chandrashekhar, an agri-business expert, said. \"However, while chana sowing may reach the normal acreage, it may not go beyond (the normal) as some farmers have shifted to wheat production, especially in states such as Madhya Pradesh where both chana and wheat are major crops,\" Chandrashekhar said. The area under oilseeds was down nearly 5% on year at 9.68 million hectares. Mustard acreage was 8.85 million hectares, down 5.6% from a year ago. The area under groundnut was up 6.7% to 365,000 hectares while the area under sunflower was up 72.1% at 74,000 hectares.',\n",

Geojit Financial Services research report on Avenue Supermarts Avenue Supermarts Ltd. (DMart) owns & operates India’s most profitable supermarket chain, DMart. It provides products like food, non-food (FMCG), general merchandise & apparel through 387 stores (total 16.1mn sq. ft). Revenue grew by 17.5% YoY, while like-for like growth (for stores operational for 24months) declined to 8.3% from 8.6% YoY. Gross margin declined by 16bps YoY to 14.1% due to lack of improvement in the product mix. EBITDA growth was 10%YoY as EBITDA margin declined by 60bps YoY to 7.9% due to higher employee costs and other expenses.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on LTIMindtree The quarterly performance was dominated by selective pockets BFS and Manufacturing, the Manufacturing growth was partly aided by passthrough component along with a ramp up of large deal. While CMT had a volume impact in 3Q owing to passing productivity benefits to a top account. Similarly, the full-quarter impact of productivity benefits would also be carried out in Q4, hence Q4 revenue would have a negative impact through CMT (productivity benefits) and missing passthrough component. The order inflows remained strong in 3Q with a slight improvement in discretionary spending, especially in the BFS segment. The management indicated that the clients are aggressively pursuing GenAI investments, the company is infusing AI into every large deal to optimize cost and drive efficiency to clients’ operations. We believe the management is quite aggressive in passing GenAI efficiency to clients in order to win higher wallet share and claim volume benefits in the near term. We are factoring in the Q4 impact of missing passthrough and lower volume on productivity commitment, which will get offset by missing furloughs and higher working day, which translates to a revenue growth of 5.5% CC YoY in FY25E. We are baking in revenue growth of 10.2% and 12.3% YoY CC in FY26E/FY27E. The execution on margins was strong in Q3, however the majority of the margin levers are fully utilized and the incremental growth would only be driven by similar uptick in volume. With compensation revision behind, the margins should see a recovery in 4Q. Despite the beat on margins, we are keeping our margin estimates unchanged for FY25E/FY26E/FY27E. With strong execution strategy and robust sales engine, LTIM is well positioned to play in the challenging environment with a mix of cost and transformation programs.

KR Choksey's research report on HDFC Asset Management Co In Q3FY25, revenue growth stood at INR 9,344 Mn, an increase of 39.2% YoY/ 5.3% QoQ, led by strong AUM growth and sequential improvement in blended yields. Revenues were 2.9% lower than our estimates. Net profit for Q3FY25 grew by 31.0% YoY (+11.2% QoQ) to INR 6,415 Mn, driven by strong operating performance and a lower tax rate compared to prior quarters.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on One 97 Communications Recent NPCI approval (Oct-24) released a major regulatory overhang, which should help it rebuild the MTU base in the next 12-18M and thus cross-sell retail financial products like loans (for eg: HL), insurance, and wealth products, thereby improving revenue per user. This, coupled with continued strong traction in merchant device subscription revenue, rising share of UPI on CC with MDR, accelerating merchant loan business with a better take rate, continued cost optimization, and rising non-operational income (including treasury income on proceeds from recent stake sale in the entertainment business/PayPay Corp) should put Paytm on the early path to profitability by FY26E, with acceleration thereafter. Paytm’s Cash/MCap stands at 21% vs 5% for Zomato, which we believe, provides strong margin of safety and can be used to accelerate business organically/inorganically or even reward shareholders via dividend/buyback. Additionally, further easing of regulatory stance via potential approval for payment aggregator license could be a positive catalyst.

Although the reported growth exceeded our estimates, there was a meaningful pass-through component built into the revenue in 3Q that is unsustainable in 4Q. Additionally, the company anticipates mild furloughs in 4Q that will lead to weaker topline performance, despite the revision in revenue guidance. Barring the anticipated quarterly volatility, the underlying demand is picking up pace. The BFS spending which until now was restricted to the US region, has extrapolated to Europe that is evident through sustainable growth in BFS and improving deal pipeline. Even Retail/CPG vertical is shaping up well with improved consumer sentiment in the US regions. The small size deals (< $50m) reported another quarter of double-digit growth, while the large deal funnel is showing strength. Although the NN component within the deal TCV has improved materially to ~60%, the cost optimization theme is still being prioritized over transformation initiatives. We believe the improved demand scenario beyond BFS and elevated deal TCV with higher NN component would help drive growth in FY26/FY27. Considering the meaningful pass-through component and extended furloughs, we are expecting a revenue de-growth in 4Q, which will translate to FY25 growth of 4.8% YoY CC. We are baking in revenue growth of 7.7%/11.8% YoY CC in FY26E/FY27E. EBIT Margins in 3Q was fairly in line with our estimates. Weak anticipated topline growth along with partial wage revision (for junior) scheduled in Q4, will have an incremental impact on margins. Having said that, the comprehensive margin expansion program (Project Maximus), pyramid rationalization, offshoring and automation would negate some of the margin impact. Hence, we are keeping our margin estimates broadly unchanged at 21.0%/21.6%/22.2% in FY25E/FY26E/FY27E. INFY has a robust play on the front-end offering and execute on the large-size transformation deals. With improving discretionary spends, we expect the global enterprises to resume their long-deferred discretionary programs, where INFY would be wining disproportionately among its peers on quality execution and full-stake offerings. We estimate USD revenues/earnings CAGR of 7.5%/12% over FY24-FY27E. The stock is currently trading at 23x FY27E, we are assigning P/E of 27x to FY27E with a target price of INR 2,250.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank AXSB saw a weak quarter as loan growth, fees and asset quality were a miss. However, core PPoP beat PLe by 2.2% as opex was 7.5% lower to PLe following softer balance sheet accretion. Slippages/provisions remained elevated due to continued unsecured stress and seasonality in agri. Loan growth was weaker at 8.8% YoY led by slowdown in retail. Bank commentary suggests that loan offtake would remain challenged due to constrained deposit addition. We trim loan/deposit growth for FY25/26/27E by avg. 2.6%/3.4% which would be partly offset by cut in opex by avg. 5.6%. Hence our core PAT for FY26/27E is lower by 3.2%/6.3%. While target multiples could be lowered across the banking sector due to a tough macro environment, quantum cut would be higher for AXSB due to weaker loan growth/asset quality.

Geojit Financial Services\\'s report on Daily Agri Picks Though the El Nino–Southern Oscillation is currently in the \\'La Nina Watch\\' range, the possibility of La Nina emerging between February and July is unlikely, the APEC Climate Center said in a report Wednesday. El Nino–Southern Oscillation \\'neutral\\' conditions are the most probable during the forecast period, with the chances increasing to 72.5% from 53.6%, according to the report. In the 2024-25 (Oct-Sept) season, mills in India have produced 13.1 million tonnes of sugar as of Wednesday, down 13.7% from 15.1 million tonnes produced in the same period a year ago, according to data from the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories. Rabi sowing across the country as of Friday was 63.2 million hectares, up just 0.1% from last year, according to data from the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The area sown under wheat, the main rabi crop, was up 1.4% on year at 32.0 million hectares, the data showed. The area under rabi paddy was up 2.6% on year at 2.21 million hectares. The acreage under maize rose nearly 10% on year to 2.24 million hectares. Above-normal rainfall during the southwest monsoon led to higher moisture content in the soil, which aided the sowing of rabi crops. The country received 8% above normal rainfall at 934.8 mm in the southwest monsoon, according to the India Meteorological Department. In the northeast monsoon, in the Oct. 1 to Dec. 31 period, India received 117.4 mm rainfall, 3% below the normal of 121.0 mm, according to the IMD. Since Jan. 1, the country has received 1.4 mm rainfall, 64% below the normal of 3.8 mm for the period. The area under pulses was 13.98 million hectares, up 0.5% from 13.91 million hectares a year ago, the data showed. Under pulses, the acreage of chana was 9.67 million hectares, up 0.8% from the area sown in the previous year. Chana is the main legume grown during the rabi season. Masur acreage was down nearly 2% at 1.74 million hectares. Chana acreage is likely to rebound to its normal of 10 million hectares from the fall seen last year, though the yield will depend on the weather in January and February, G. Chandrashekhar, an agri-business expert, said. \"However, while chana sowing may reach the normal acreage, it may not go beyond (the normal) as some farmers have shifted to wheat production, especially in states such as Madhya Pradesh where both chana and wheat are major crops,\" Chandrashekhar said. The area under oilseeds was down nearly 5% on year at 9.68 million hectares. Mustard acreage was 8.85 million hectares, down 5.6% from a year ago. The area under groundnut was up 6.7% to 365,000 hectares while the area under sunflower was up 72.1% at 74,000 hectares.',\n",

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on LTIMindtree The quarterly performance was dominated by selective pockets BFS and Manufacturing, the Manufacturing growth was partly aided by passthrough component along with a ramp up of large deal. While CMT had a volume impact in 3Q owing to passing productivity benefits to a top account. Similarly, the full-quarter impact of productivity benefits would also be carried out in Q4, hence Q4 revenue would have a negative impact through CMT (productivity benefits) and missing passthrough component. The order inflows remained strong in 3Q with a slight improvement in discretionary spending, especially in the BFS segment. The management indicated that the clients are aggressively pursuing GenAI investments, the company is infusing AI into every large deal to optimize cost and drive efficiency to clients’ operations. We believe the management is quite aggressive in passing GenAI efficiency to clients in order to win higher wallet share and claim volume benefits in the near term. We are factoring in the Q4 impact of missing passthrough and lower volume on productivity commitment, which will get offset by missing furloughs and higher working day, which translates to a revenue growth of 5.5% CC YoY in FY25E. We are baking in revenue growth of 10.2% and 12.3% YoY CC in FY26E/FY27E. The execution on margins was strong in Q3, however the majority of the margin levers are fully utilized and the incremental growth would only be driven by similar uptick in volume. With compensation revision behind, the margins should see a recovery in 4Q. Despite the beat on margins, we are keeping our margin estimates unchanged for FY25E/FY26E/FY27E. With strong execution strategy and robust sales engine, LTIM is well positioned to play in the challenging environment with a mix of cost and transformation programs.

Net profit for Q3FY25 grew by 31.0% YoY (+11.2% QoQ) to INR 6,415 Mn, driven by strong operating performance and a lower tax rate compared to prior quarters. HDFCAMC’s expansion into thematic and sector-specific funds, coupled with its efforts to rationalize distributor commissions, has bolstered its market position and enhanced cost efficiency during the quarter. We revised our EPS estimates downwards for FY26E and FY27E by 9.0% and 10.1%, respectively, as the company is shifting towards lower-cost strategies, including an increased on passive funds resulting in equity yields falling, thus resulting in reduced revenue. We are applying a P/E multiple of 35x on FY27E EPS of INR 145.6 to arrive at a target price of INR 5,095 per share (earlier INR 5,388), an upside of 25.9% over the CMP. However, given the recent share price correction, we have upgraded our rating to “BUY” from “ACCUMULATE” on the shares of HDFCAMC.\",\n",

Emkay Global Financial's research report on One 97 Communications Recent NPCI approval (Oct-24) released a major regulatory overhang, which should help it rebuild the MTU base in the next 12-18M and thus cross-sell retail financial products like loans (for eg: HL), insurance, and wealth products, thereby improving revenue per user. This, coupled with continued strong traction in merchant device subscription revenue, rising share of UPI on CC with MDR, accelerating merchant loan business with a better take rate, continued cost optimization, and rising non-operational income (including treasury income on proceeds from recent stake sale in the entertainment business/PayPay Corp) should put Paytm on the early path to profitability by FY26E, with acceleration thereafter. Paytm’s Cash/MCap stands at 21% vs 5% for Zomato, which we believe, provides strong margin of safety and can be used to accelerate business organically/inorganically or even reward shareholders via dividend/buyback. Additionally, further easing of regulatory stance via potential approval for payment aggregator license could be a positive catalyst.

Although the reported growth exceeded our estimates, there was a meaningful pass-through component built into the revenue in 3Q that is unsustainable in 4Q. Additionally, the company anticipates mild furloughs in 4Q that will lead to weaker topline performance, despite the revision in revenue guidance. Barring the anticipated quarterly volatility, the underlying demand is picking up pace. The BFS spending which until now was restricted to the US region, has extrapolated to Europe that is evident through sustainable growth in BFS and improving deal pipeline. Even Retail/CPG vertical is shaping up well with improved consumer sentiment in the US regions. The small size deals (< $50m) reported another quarter of double-digit growth, while the large deal funnel is showing strength. Although the NN component within the deal TCV has improved materially to ~60%, the cost optimization theme is still being prioritized over transformation initiatives. We believe the improved demand scenario beyond BFS and elevated deal TCV with higher NN component would help drive growth in FY26/FY27. Considering the meaningful pass-through component and extended furloughs, we are expecting a revenue de-growth in 4Q, which will translate to FY25 growth of 4.8% YoY CC. We are baking in revenue growth of 7.7%/11.8% YoY CC in FY26E/FY27E. EBIT Margins in 3Q was fairly in line with our estimates. Weak anticipated topline growth along with partial wage revision (for junior) scheduled in Q4, will have an incremental impact on margins. Having said that, the comprehensive margin expansion program (Project Maximus), pyramid rationalization, offshoring and automation would negate some of the margin impact. Hence, we are keeping our margin estimates broadly unchanged at 21.0%/21.6%/22.2% in FY25E/FY26E/FY27E. INFY has a robust play on the front-end offering and execute on the large-size transformation deals. With improving discretionary spends, we expect the global enterprises to resume their long-deferred discretionary programs, where INFY would be wining disproportionately among its peers on quality execution and full-stake offerings. We estimate USD revenues/earnings CAGR of 7.5%/12% over FY24-FY27E. The stock is currently trading at 23x FY27E, we are assigning P/E of 27x to FY27E with a target price of INR 2,250.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank AXSB saw a weak quarter as loan growth, fees and asset quality were a miss.

Revenue grew by 17.5% YoY, while like-for like growth (for stores operational for 24months) declined to 8.3% from 8.6% YoY. Gross margin declined by 16bps YoY to 14.1% due to lack of improvement in the product mix. EBITDA growth was 10%YoY as EBITDA margin declined by 60bps YoY to 7.9% due to higher employee costs and other expenses. General merchandise & apparel category mix which commands a higher margin has not seen any material improvement from last year despite festive season. Strong store additions continued as DMart has added 22 stores in 9MFY25 vs. 17 YoY (41 stores in FY24). This will support future topline growth. DMart is gradually improving its E-Com business channel, ‘DMart Ready’, currently available in ~25 cities (24 QoQ), which now contributes ~2.5% of total revenue. DMart Ready business grew by 21.5% YoY in 9MFY25. DMart currently trades at 69x 1Yr Fwd PE (2yr avg =78x). We reduced our earnings estimates and revised our target to Rs.4,107 (earlier Rs. 4,471) by valuing on a DCF basis which implies 62x on FY27 EPS.',\n",

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on LTIMindtree The quarterly performance was dominated by selective pockets BFS and Manufacturing, the Manufacturing growth was partly aided by passthrough component along with a ramp up of large deal. While CMT had a volume impact in 3Q owing to passing productivity benefits to a top account. Similarly, the full-quarter impact of productivity benefits would also be carried out in Q4, hence Q4 revenue would have a negative impact through CMT (productivity benefits) and missing passthrough component. The order inflows remained strong in 3Q with a slight improvement in discretionary spending, especially in the BFS segment. The management indicated that the clients are aggressively pursuing GenAI investments, the company is infusing AI into every large deal to optimize cost and drive efficiency to clients’ operations. We believe the management is quite aggressive in passing GenAI efficiency to clients in order to win higher wallet share and claim volume benefits in the near term. We are factoring in the Q4 impact of missing passthrough and lower volume on productivity commitment, which will get offset by missing furloughs and higher working day, which translates to a revenue growth of 5.5% CC YoY in FY25E. We are baking in revenue growth of 10.2% and 12.3% YoY CC in FY26E/FY27E. The execution on margins was strong in Q3, however the majority of the margin levers are fully utilized and the incremental growth would only be driven by similar uptick in volume. With compensation revision behind, the margins should see a recovery in 4Q. Despite the beat on margins, we are keeping our margin estimates unchanged for FY25E/FY26E/FY27E. With strong execution strategy and robust sales engine, LTIM is well positioned to play in the challenging environment with a mix of cost and transformation programs. We are baking in USD revenue/earnings CAGR of 8.8% and 11.9%, respectively. We are assigning P/E of 32x to FY27E with a target price of INR 7,000. Maintain BUY.\",\n",

KR Choksey's research report on HDFC Asset Management Co In Q3FY25, revenue growth stood at INR 9,344 Mn, an increase of 39.2% YoY/ 5.3% QoQ, led by strong AUM growth and sequential improvement in blended yields. Revenues were 2.9% lower than our estimates. Net profit for Q3FY25 grew by 31.0% YoY (+11.2% QoQ) to INR 6,415 Mn, driven by strong operating performance and a lower tax rate compared to prior quarters. HDFCAMC’s expansion into thematic and sector-specific funds, coupled with its efforts to rationalize distributor commissions, has bolstered its market position and enhanced cost efficiency during the quarter. We revised our EPS estimates downwards for FY26E and FY27E by 9.0% and 10.1%, respectively, as the company is shifting towards lower-cost strategies, including an increased on passive funds resulting in equity yields falling, thus resulting in reduced revenue. We are applying a P/E multiple of 35x on FY27E EPS of INR 145.6 to arrive at a target price of INR 5,095 per share (earlier INR 5,388), an upside of 25.9% over the CMP.

Despite implementation of the new surrender regulations, VNB margin for the Quarter at 26.1% came in better than our estimate of 24.2%, driven by better product-level margins on account of better persistency and higher attachment rate of protection products. The management changed the commission structure by introducing a claw-back provision, or deferring the commission or by reducing commission, to mitigate the impact of the new surrender regulations. The management remains confident of delivering 18-20% APE growth and VNB growth of around 15% for FY25E.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on One 97 Communications Recent NPCI approval (Oct-24) released a major regulatory overhang, which should help it rebuild the MTU base in the next 12-18M and thus cross-sell retail financial products like loans (for eg: HL), insurance, and wealth products, thereby improving revenue per user. This, coupled with continued strong traction in merchant device subscription revenue, rising share of UPI on CC with MDR, accelerating merchant loan business with a better take rate, continued cost optimization, and rising non-operational income (including treasury income on proceeds from recent stake sale in the entertainment business/PayPay Corp) should put Paytm on the early path to profitability by FY26E, with acceleration thereafter. Paytm’s Cash/MCap stands at 21% vs 5% for Zomato, which we believe, provides strong margin of safety and can be used to accelerate business organically/inorganically or even reward shareholders via dividend/buyback. Additionally, further easing of regulatory stance via potential approval for payment aggregator license could be a positive catalyst. We upgrade Paytm to BUY from Add with revised DCF-based TP of Rs1,050 (earlier Rs750), implying FY27E EV/Op Rev at 4.5x and P/BV at 4.2x.\",\n",

Although the reported growth exceeded our estimates, there was a meaningful pass-through component built into the revenue in 3Q that is unsustainable in 4Q. Additionally, the company anticipates mild furloughs in 4Q that will lead to weaker topline performance, despite the revision in revenue guidance. Barring the anticipated quarterly volatility, the underlying demand is picking up pace. The BFS spending which until now was restricted to the US region, has extrapolated to Europe that is evident through sustainable growth in BFS and improving deal pipeline. Even Retail/CPG vertical is shaping up well with improved consumer sentiment in the US regions. The small size deals (< $50m) reported another quarter of double-digit growth, while the large deal funnel is showing strength. Although the NN component within the deal TCV has improved materially to ~60%, the cost optimization theme is still being prioritized over transformation initiatives. We believe the improved demand scenario beyond BFS and elevated deal TCV with higher NN component would help drive growth in FY26/FY27. Considering the meaningful pass-through component and extended furloughs, we are expecting a revenue de-growth in 4Q, which will translate to FY25 growth of 4.8% YoY CC. We are baking in revenue growth of 7.7%/11.8% YoY CC in FY26E/FY27E. EBIT Margins in 3Q was fairly in line with our estimates. Weak anticipated topline growth along with partial wage revision (for junior) scheduled in Q4, will have an incremental impact on margins. Having said that, the comprehensive margin expansion program (Project Maximus), pyramid rationalization, offshoring and automation would negate some of the margin impact. Hence, we are keeping our margin estimates broadly unchanged at 21.0%/21.6%/22.2% in FY25E/FY26E/FY27E. INFY has a robust play on the front-end offering and execute on the large-size transformation deals. With improving discretionary spends, we expect the global enterprises to resume their long-deferred discretionary programs, where INFY would be wining disproportionately among its peers on quality execution and full-stake offerings. We estimate USD revenues/earnings CAGR of 7.5%/12% over FY24-FY27E. The stock is currently trading at 23x FY27E, we are assigning P/E of 27x to FY27E with a target price of INR 2,250.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank AXSB saw a weak quarter as loan growth, fees and asset quality were a miss. However, core PPoP beat PLe by 2.2% as opex was 7.5% lower to PLe following softer balance sheet accretion. Slippages/provisions remained elevated due to continued unsecured stress and seasonality in agri. Loan growth was weaker at 8.8% YoY led by slowdown in retail. Bank commentary suggests that loan offtake would remain challenged due to constrained deposit addition. We trim loan/deposit growth for FY25/26/27E by avg. 2.6%/3.4% which would be partly offset by cut in opex by avg. 5.6%. Hence our core PAT for FY26/27E is lower by 3.2%/6.3%. While target multiples could be lowered across the banking sector due to a tough macro environment, quantum cut would be higher for AXSB due to weaker loan growth/asset quality. We trim multiple from 2.2x to 1.9x on Sep’26 ABV and lower TP to Rs1,350 from Rs1,530. Retain ‘BUY’.\",\n",

EBITDA rose 11% YoY, driven by higher gross margins on lower write-offs and improved intake margins in private brands.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on LTIMindtree The quarterly performance was dominated by selective pockets BFS and Manufacturing, the Manufacturing growth was partly aided by passthrough component along with a ramp up of large deal. While CMT had a volume impact in 3Q owing to passing productivity benefits to a top account. Similarly, the full-quarter impact of productivity benefits would also be carried out in Q4, hence Q4 revenue would have a negative impact through CMT (productivity benefits) and missing passthrough component. The order inflows remained strong in 3Q with a slight improvement in discretionary spending, especially in the BFS segment. The management indicated that the clients are aggressively pursuing GenAI investments, the company is infusing AI into every large deal to optimize cost and drive efficiency to clients’ operations. We believe the management is quite aggressive in passing GenAI efficiency to clients in order to win higher wallet share and claim volume benefits in the near term. We are factoring in the Q4 impact of missing passthrough and lower volume on productivity commitment, which will get offset by missing furloughs and higher working day, which translates to a revenue growth of 5.5% CC YoY in FY25E. We are baking in revenue growth of 10.2% and 12.3% YoY CC in FY26E/FY27E. The execution on margins was strong in Q3, however the majority of the margin levers are fully utilized and the incremental growth would only be driven by similar uptick in volume. With compensation revision behind, the margins should see a recovery in 4Q. Despite the beat on margins, we are keeping our margin estimates unchanged for FY25E/FY26E/FY27E. With strong execution strategy and robust sales engine, LTIM is well positioned to play in the challenging environment with a mix of cost and transformation programs. We are baking in USD revenue/earnings CAGR of 8.8% and 11.9%, respectively. We are assigning P/E of 32x to FY27E with a target price of INR 7,000. Maintain BUY.\",\n",

KR Choksey's research report on HDFC Asset Management Co In Q3FY25, revenue growth stood at INR 9,344 Mn, an increase of 39.2% YoY/ 5.3% QoQ, led by strong AUM growth and sequential improvement in blended yields. Revenues were 2.9% lower than our estimates. Net profit for Q3FY25 grew by 31.0% YoY (+11.2% QoQ) to INR 6,415 Mn, driven by strong operating performance and a lower tax rate compared to prior quarters. HDFCAMC’s expansion into thematic and sector-specific funds, coupled with its efforts to rationalize distributor commissions, has bolstered its market position and enhanced cost efficiency during the quarter. We revised our EPS estimates downwards for FY26E and FY27E by 9.0% and 10.1%, respectively, as the company is shifting towards lower-cost strategies, including an increased on passive funds resulting in equity yields falling, thus resulting in reduced revenue. We are applying a P/E multiple of 35x on FY27E EPS of INR 145.6 to arrive at a target price of INR 5,095 per share (earlier INR 5,388), an upside of 25.9% over the CMP.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on HDFC Life Insurance HDFCLIFE reported an impressive performance in 9MFY25, with APE 1.6% above our estimate at Rs102.9bn, and VNB margin at 25.1% above our estimate of 24.5% resulting in a 4.2% beat on VNB at Rs25.9bn. Despite implementation of the new surrender regulations, VNB margin for the Quarter at 26.1% came in better than our estimate of 24.2%, driven by better product-level margins on account of better persistency and higher attachment rate of protection products. The management changed the commission structure by introducing a claw-back provision, or deferring the commission or by reducing commission, to mitigate the impact of the new surrender regulations. The management remains confident of delivering 18-20% APE growth and VNB growth of around 15% for FY25E. To bake in the Q3 developments, we increase our APE estimates by ~1% and VNB margin estimates by 10-40bps, resulting in a ~2-3% increase in VNB over FY25-27E.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on One 97 Communications Recent NPCI approval (Oct-24) released a major regulatory overhang, which should help it rebuild the MTU base in the next 12-18M and thus cross-sell retail financial products like loans (for eg: HL), insurance, and wealth products, thereby improving revenue per user. This, coupled with continued strong traction in merchant device subscription revenue, rising share of UPI on CC with MDR, accelerating merchant loan business with a better take rate, continued cost optimization, and rising non-operational income (including treasury income on proceeds from recent stake sale in the entertainment business/PayPay Corp) should put Paytm on the early path to profitability by FY26E, with acceleration thereafter. Paytm’s Cash/MCap stands at 21% vs 5% for Zomato, which we believe, provides strong margin of safety and can be used to accelerate business organically/inorganically or even reward shareholders via dividend/buyback. Additionally, further easing of regulatory stance via potential approval for payment aggregator license could be a positive catalyst. We upgrade Paytm to BUY from Add with revised DCF-based TP of Rs1,050 (earlier Rs750), implying FY27E EV/Op Rev at 4.5x and P/BV at 4.2x.\",\n",
